Cross Compiling Python for Embedded Linux
Posted by Paul Gibson on	 16 November 2011, 2:48 pm
This article details how to cross compile Python for the ARM and PowerPC platforms.  
It should apply equally to other platforms as well, just plug-in the correct cross-compiler. 
 The article supports Python versions, 2.6.6 (Thanks to evadeflow), 2.7.2, 2.7.3 (thanks to Lothsahn) and 3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3, 3.2.2.

Firstly, download the Python that you want to use from http://www.python.org/

Unpack the Python package using tar:

tar -xvzf Python-2.7.2.tgz
This will create a directory called Python-2.7.2.  Goto the directory:

cd Python-2.7.2
Then run these commands to build the host components:

./configure

make python Parser/pgen

mv python hostpython

mv Parser/pgen Parser/hostpgen

make distclean
Download the correct patch for your version of Python:

Python-2.6.6-xcompile.patch
Python-2.7.2-xcompile.patch (With ctypes thanks to Jaux (jaux.net)
Python-2.7.3-xcompile.patch ( Thanks to Lothsahn)
Python-3.1.1-xcompile.patch
Python-3.1.2-xcompile.patch
Python-3.1.3-xcompile.patch
Python-3.2.2-xcompile.patch
Then apply the patch:

patch -p1 < Python-2.7.2-xcompile.patch
